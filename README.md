🔸 Cuisine Analysis: Visualize the count of cuisines and their aggregate ratings to identify popular and high-performing cuisines.
🔸 Table Booking and Online Delivery: Understand the distribution of restaurants offering table bookings and online delivery options.
🔸 Rating Distribution: Analyze customer feedback through rating text and color-coded visualizations for easy interpretation.
🔸 City-level Analysis: Dive into restaurant data at the city level, including the percentage contribution of restaurants from top cities.
🔸 Geographical Mapping: A dynamic map visualization highlights the restaurant spread globally.

💡 Why This Dashboard Matters:
This project showcases the power of data visualization in understanding industry patterns, customer preferences, and operational trends. The interactive features make it user-friendly and practical for stakeholders to derive actionable insights.
